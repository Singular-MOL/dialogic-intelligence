Dialogic Intelligence Architecture (DIA)

Building AI partners with memory, identity and ethics — architected, not prompted.

> Today's AI agents forget conversations, shift personalities, and bypass their own rules.  
> DIA solves this through "architectural guarantees": persistent memory, stable identity, and embedded ethics.

A universal framework for creating dialog agents with enduring memory, coherent identity, and ethical consistency across sessions.

```

DIA = (I, S, M, P, C)

where:

I- Identity Core (immutable)

S- State (structured memory)

M- Memory Engine (update protocols)

P- Processor (LLM + reflective critic)

C- Transparency Config

```

🎯 Core Architecture

Two-layer design with explicit state separation:

· Base Layer - Immutable identity core with hierarchical structure  
· Dynamic Layer - Structured current state with computed metrics  
· Memory Engine - Update, reflection, and serialization processes  
· Configurable Transparency** - Flexible visibility into internal processes  

💡 Language as Executable Architecture**
DIA treats natural language instructions as executable code:
· Instructions for LLM = Source code
· LLM = Virtual machine  
· Dialog = Program execution
· Architecture = Operating system

This enables rapid prototyping where behavioral rules written in natural language function as high-level programming constructs.

🚀 Quick Start

For Researchers:
1. Read `/docs/whitepaper.md` for architectural overview  
2. Explore `/agents/Indigo/` for advanced implementation  
3. Utilize `/modules/` for specific component integration  

For Developers:
1. Start with `/chatbots/cinema_guide/` for basic implementation  
2. Study `/agents/Indigo/` for semantic graph approaches  
3. Integrate modules from `/modules/` as needed  

📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Standard Agent | DIA Agent |
