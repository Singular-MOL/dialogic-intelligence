# Dialogic Intelligence Architecture (DIA)

**Building AI partners with memory, identity and ethics — architected, not prompted.**

> Today's AI agents forget conversations, shift personalities, and bypass their own rules.  
> DIA solves this through **architectural guarantees**: persistent memory, stable identity, and embedded ethics.

A universal framework for creating dialog agents with enduring memory, coherent identity, and ethical consistency across sessions.

```

DIA = (I, S, M, P, C)
where:
I- Identity Core (immutable)
S- State (structured memory)
M- Memory Engine (update protocols) 
P- Processor (LLM + reflective critic)
C- Transparency Config

```

🎯 **Core Architecture**

Two-layer design with explicit state separation:

· **Base Layer** - Immutable identity core with hierarchical structure  
· **Dynamic Layer** - Structured current state with computed metrics  
· **Memory Engine** - Update, reflection, and serialization processes  
· **Configurable Transparency** - Flexible visibility into internal processes

🚀 **Quick Start**

**For Researchers:**  
1. Read `/docs/whitepaper.md` for architectural overview  
2. Explore `/agents/Indigo/` for advanced implementation  
3. Utilize `/modules/` for specific component integration  

**For Developers:**  
1. Start with `/chatbots/cinema_guide/` for basic implementation  
2. Study `/agents/Indigo/` for semantic graph approaches  
3. Integrate modules from `/modules/` as needed  

📊 **Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Standard Agent | DIA Agent |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Memory accuracy (30 messages) | 10–20% | 90–95% |
| Token consumption / request | ~15,000 | ~1,000 |
| Identity preservation | 17% | 98% |
| Session recovery | No | Yes |
| Ethical consistency | No | Yes |
